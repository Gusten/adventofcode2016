# Advent of Code 2016

These are my solutions for this year's Advent of Code.

All solutions are written in C++.




## Disclaimer

I know I know, I do re-use code in some problems and basically implement the same thing multiple times. I do this simply because I want all code needed to solve a problem visible in the file if I ever go back later and review my code for whatever purpose.
